Lapis - Todo list

## Specific items

*  (done) Cloudflare setup (put site behind cloudflare but bypass the cloudflare network for API requests)

## Suggested features

* Set up automatic deployment when a pr is created (have wildcard Apache set up so $1.lapis.dev goes to /home/lapis/$1 - maybe create separate repo for this setup with the github webhook)
